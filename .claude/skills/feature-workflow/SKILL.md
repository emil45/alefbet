# /feature-workflow

Autonomous end-to-end feature development. Fetches next task from task tracker and works independently until complete or help is needed.

---

## Context

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **Task Agent** | `monday-agent` (swap for `jira-agent` etc.) |
| **Build Command** | `npm run build` |
| **Test Command** | `npm test -- --workers=1` |
| **Review Agents** | code-reviewer → silent-failure-hunter → code-simplifier |

### Tech Stack
Next.js 16, TypeScript, MUI, Firebase, next-intl (he/en/ru)

### File Structure
```
app/[locale]/     → Pages (server: page.tsx, client: *Content.tsx)
components/       → UI components
hooks/            → Custom hooks (useCelebration, useGameAnalytics, useFeatureFlags)
contexts/         → React contexts (FeatureFlagContext, StickerContext, StreakContext)
utils/            → Utilities (audio.ts, celebrations.ts)
data/             → Static data arrays
lib/              → External integrations (firebase.ts, seo.ts, featureFlags/)
```

### Key Patterns
- Audio: `playSound(AudioSounds.X)` for effects, `playAudio(path)` for content
- Celebrations: `useCelebration` hook with types: gameComplete, milestone, correctAnswer, streak
- Feature Flags: `useFeatureFlagContext().getFlag('flagName')` - defaults to `false`, enabled via Firebase Remote Config
- Category Progress: `useCategoryProgress` hook for tracking discovery/practice milestones. Wrap with category-specific hooks (e.g., `useLettersProgress`). Handles localStorage with proper error handling.
- Games Progress: `useGamesProgressContext()` tracks game completions, achievements (Simon scores, memory wins, etc.) for sticker unlocks.

### Known Gaps
- **Word audio files missing**: `/public/audio/words/` doesn't exist yet. `hebrewWords.ts` has `audioFile` paths but they 404. Don't add code to play these until files exist.
- **Explorer stickers not implemented**: Page 6 (Explorer) stickers have `unlockType: 'future'`. Pages 1-5 (Letters, Numbers, Animals, Games, Streaks) ARE fully implemented.
- **letter-tracing game disabled**: Game code exists in `app/[locale]/games/letter-tracing/` but is disabled (removed from games menu, sitemap, tests). Pixel-based and checkpoint-based validation approaches failed - checkpoint positions don't align with font-rendered letters. Needs a visual calibration tool or different approach (e.g., SVG paths instead of font rendering).

### Translation Key Patterns
Game translations have **inconsistent paths** - check before using:
- `speedChallenge`, `simonGame`, `letterRain` → Root level: `t('speedChallenge.xyz')`
- `countingGame` → Under games: `t('games.countingGame.xyz')`

Always verify the actual path in `messages/he.json` before writing translation calls.

### Testing Rules
- **Add tests**: New pages, new games, major UI changes
- **Skip tests**: Copy changes, styling, adding category items

## Design Philosophy

> Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back—show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.

### Mindset

This is a **children's learning app**. Every feature should spark joy, wonder, and delight. Generic is the enemy. Safe is forgettable. Kids deserve magic.

**Before coding any UI, ask:**
- What would make a 4-year-old's eyes light up?
- How can this feel like play, not work?
- What unexpected detail would make this memorable?

### Creative Principles

**1. Bold Over Safe**
Don't settle for "it works." Push for "this is delightful." A button could bounce. A transition could whoosh. Success could explode with confetti. Take creative risks.

**2. Personality Over Polish**
Generic rounded rectangles are forgettable. Give elements character. A loading state could be playful. An error could be gentle and encouraging. Everything communicates.

**3. Reward Every Interaction**
Children need constant positive feedback. Every tap should feel responsive. Every correct answer should celebrate. Every milestone should feel earned. Use `useCelebration` liberally.

**4. Sensory Richness**
Combine visual + audio + motion. A card flip with sound. A success with confetti AND fanfare. Multiple senses = deeper engagement.

**5. Surprise & Delight**
Add unexpected moments. Easter eggs. Playful animations. Sounds that make kids giggle. The details they'll show their parents.

### UI Guidelines

| Element | Guideline |
|---------|-----------|
| **Touch targets** | Minimum 48px, larger for small fingers |
| **Typography** | Large, clear, playful - never small text |
| **Colors** | Pastel palette from `theme.ts` - warm, inviting |
| **Animations** | Bouncy, celebratory - use spring physics |
| **Feedback** | Every interaction = visual + audio response |
| **Layout** | Breathing room, one clear action per view |

### Sticker Guidelines

When adding stickers:
- **Be generous**: Kids love collecting - add 8-12 stickers per page, not 3-5
- **Unique emojis**: Never reuse the same emoji across different sticker pages
- **Progressive milestones**: Add multiple levels (e.g., Simon 5, 7, 10 - not just 10)
- **Mix achievement types**: Combine easy wins (play once) with challenges (perfect score)

### Design Anti-Patterns

- Generic UI that could be any app
- Subtle animations kids won't notice
- Small text or tiny touch targets
- Silent interactions (no feedback)
- Overwhelming complexity
- "Adult" aesthetics (sharp, minimal, cold)
- Stingy rewards (kids want MORE stickers, not fewer)

## Workflow

```
ACQUIRE → EXPLORE → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → SEO → REVIEW → TEST → SHIP → RETRO
```

Execute phases sequentially. No approval gates. Ask for help only if stuck after 3 attempts.

---

## Phase 1: Acquire

**Goal**: Get next task from task tracker.

1. **Launch task agent** to fetch the next task:
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "monday-agent"` (or configured task agent)
   - Prompt: `"fetch"`
   - Agent returns: task ID, name, description, updates/comments, previous status

2. **Store the task ID** - you'll need it in Phase 8 to mark as Done

3. **If task is vague** (e.g., "fix issues", "validate", "improve"):
   - Explore the relevant code first
   - List specific issues found before planning fixes
   - If still unclear after exploration, ask user for clarification

4. Create TodoWrite with task breakdown

5. If no tasks: Report "No pending tasks" and stop

---

## Phase 2: Explore

**Goal**: Understand codebase before coding.

1. Launch 2-3 Explore agents in parallel to find:
   - Similar features and patterns
   - Files that need changes
   - Existing utilities/hooks to reuse

2. Read all identified key files

3. Update TodoWrite with specific files to modify/create

---

## Phase 3: Plan

**Goal**: Break down into concrete steps.

1. Create detailed TodoWrite:
   - Each todo = one logical change
   - Order by dependency
   - Include build verification

2. Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones

---

## Phase 4: Implement

**Goal**: Build the feature.

1. For each todo:
   - Mark `in_progress`
   - Make change following existing patterns
   - Mark `completed`

2. **UI translations**: Add strings to `messages/{he,en,ru}.json` for any user-facing text

3. **New game checklist**:
   - Add to `GameType` union in `models/amplitudeEvents.ts` (required for analytics)
   - Add to `ALL_GAME_TYPES` array in `hooks/useGamesProgress.ts` (for sticker tracking)
   - Add button in `app/[locale]/games/GamesContent.tsx`
   - Add route to `app/sitemap.ts`
   - Add to games array in `e2e/app.spec.ts`

4. **Feature flags**: If feature needs gradual rollout, wrap with `getFlag('flagName')`. Add flag to `lib/featureFlags/types.ts` with default `false` (enabled via Firebase Remote Config)

5. **Tests** (if needed per Testing Rules): Add to `e2e/app.spec.ts`

6. Run **Build Command** - fix ALL errors before proceeding

7. If stuck >3 attempts: Ask for help

---

## Phase 5: SEO

**Goal**: Ensure new pages/routes are discoverable.

**Skip this phase if**: No new pages or routes were created.

### For New Pages:

1. **Add translation keys** in `messages/{he,en,ru}.json`:
   ```json
   "seo": {
     "pages": {
       "yourPage": {
         "title": "...",
         "description": "..."
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Generate metadata** in `page.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   export async function generateMetadata({ params }: Props) {
     const { locale } = await params;
     return generatePageMetadata(locale, 'yourPage', '/your-path');
   }
   ```

3. **Update sitemap** in `app/sitemap.ts`:
   - Add route to the `routes` array
   - Set appropriate priority (0.9 content, 0.6 games, 0.5 info)
   - Hreflang alternates are auto-generated for all locales

4. **Structured data** (if applicable):
   - FAQ page? Add FAQPage JSON-LD (see `learn/page.tsx`)
   - Game with scores? Consider adding Game schema

### Checklist:
- [ ] SEO translations in all 3 locales
- [ ] `generateMetadata` exports in page.tsx
- [ ] Route added to `app/sitemap.ts`

---

## Phase 6: Review

**Goal**: Catch issues before testing.

Run **Review Agents** sequentially. **Important**: Scope each agent to only the files you modified, not the entire codebase.

### 6.1 code-reviewer
- Prompt: "Review changes to [list specific files]. Focus on bugs, logic errors, guideline violations."
- Fix critical/high severity issues

### 6.2 silent-failure-hunter
- Prompt: "Review error handling in [list specific files] for silent failures."
- If issues are found in patterns you're copying from (e.g., useLettersProgress → useAnimalsProgress), fix BOTH:
  1. Your new code
  2. The original code you copied from
- This improves the codebase over time rather than propagating debt

### 6.3 code-simplifier
- Prompt: "Review [list specific files] for unnecessary complexity."
- Apply clarity improvements

After fixes: Re-run **Build Command**

---

## Phase 7: Test

**Goal**: Verify nothing broke.

1. **New game?** Add to games array in `e2e/app.spec.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const games = ['simon-game', 'guess-game', ..., 'your-new-game'];
   ```

2. Run **Test Command** (single worker avoids race conditions)

3. If fails:
   - **Failures in files YOU modified**: Fix the issue, re-run
   - **Failures in unrelated files**: Note them and proceed (pre-existing issues)
   - Re-run reviews if fix was significant
   - After 3 failures on YOUR code: Ask for help

4. If passes: Proceed to Ship

**Don't**: Use `git stash` to verify if failures are pre-existing. Just check if the failing test files relate to your changes.

---

## Phase 8: Ship

**Goal**: Commit, push, close task.

1. **Check working directory**: Run `git status`
   - If unrelated files are modified, ask user: "Include [file] in commit or revert?"
   - Don't silently revert or include without asking

2. **Commit** (types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `style`, `docs`, `test`):
```bash
git add <specific-files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

3. **Push**: `git push`

4. **Close task**: Launch task agent to mark as Done:
   - Use Task tool with `subagent_type: "monday-agent"` (or configured task agent)
   - Prompt: `"done <item_id>"` (use the task ID from Phase 1)

5. **Summary**: Report files changed, decisions made, follow-ups

---

## Phase 9: Retro

**Goal**: Learn and improve the workflow.

Quick self-reflection focused on what went wrong, not what went well.

1. **Self-reflect**: What mistakes were made? What took longer than expected?

2. **If improvements identified**:
   - Update this skill file (Key Patterns, Known Gaps, Anti-Patterns, or phase instructions)
   - Commit the skill update separately from feature code

3. **Keep it brief** - 1-2 minutes max. Skip if nothing significant.

**Good retro outputs:**
- New anti-pattern discovered → add to Anti-Patterns
- New codebase pattern used → add to Key Patterns
- Workflow step was confusing → clarify instructions
- Missing context caused issues → add to Known Gaps

---

## Error Handling

### Ask for help when:
- Build/test fails 3+ times on same issue
- Requirements unclear
- Major architectural decision needed

### Format:
```
I'm stuck on [issue].

Tried:
1. [attempt]
2. [attempt]
3. [attempt]

Error: [specific error]

Options:
- [A]
- [B]

Which approach?
```

---

## Workflow Anti-Patterns

- Coding before exploring codebase
- Creating files when editing existing works
- Skipping reviews "because it's small"
- Over-engineering for hypothetical needs
- Committing without tests passing
- Forgetting UI translations for new text
- Skipping SEO for new pages
- Using `git stash` to verify pre-existing test failures (just check file names)
- Silently reverting unrelated working directory changes without asking
- Running review agents on entire codebase instead of scoping to changed files
- Adding code that references missing assets (check files exist first)
- Using `replace_all: true` without checking it won't break imports or create duplicates
- Copying code patterns from existing files without reviewing them (existing code may have bugs - e.g., `scale()` without value)
