# Lepdy 2.0 Product Strategy, UX Plan, and Growth Roadmap
**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** 2026-01-17  
**Scope:** Product, UX, content, measurement, growth (Hebrew + English + Russian)

---

## 1. Executive summary (what matters most)
- Lepdy’s fastest path to “next level” is **not more pages**, it is turning the current content into a **learning system** with progression, short routines, and visible wins.
- The product should optimize one loop: **Discover → Tap → Hear → Repeat → Win → Return**.
- Biggest upside comes from **retention mechanics without accounts** (daily mission, local streaks, sticker book, progress map).
- Your durable differentiator is **authentic native Hebrew audio**. Make it feel special through signature experiences, not just category lists.
- Build 2-3 signature experiences and execute them extremely well:
  1) Letter tracing + pronunciation reinforcement  
  2) Read-along micro stories  
  3) Short song snippets and rhythm drills (10-15 seconds)
- Keep the product **child-safe by default**: no dark patterns, no behavioral ads, no child profiling.
- Add **parent-only surfaces** (parent gate) for settings, reporting issues, progress views, sharing, and later accounts.
- Invest early in **measurement** (privacy-first). Baseline retention and activation before big feature bets.
- Improve **first-session activation** with a 60-second “Start Here” guided experience.
- Depth comes from progression: letter recognition → sound matching → final forms → tracing → syllables → words.
- Growth should compound through SEO per page type, diaspora communities, preschools, and educator packs.
- Run the roadmap as experiments with explicit success criteria and weekly iteration.

## 2. Current state snapshot
### 2.1 What you already have
- Multilingual UI: Hebrew, English, Russian.
- Foundational categories: letters, numbers, colors, shapes, animals, food.
- A set of simple games (memory, speed, word builder, guess game, simon).
- Simple kid-friendly interaction model: tap, hear, repeat.

### 2.2 What is missing to feel “top tier”
- Guided learning path and progression.
- A clear “success moment” in under 60 seconds for first-time visitors.
- A return reason that does not require login.
- Parent trust surfaces: about, safety, feedback, progress summary.
- Strong landing-page copy per category (especially in Hebrew) to explain value and improve SEO.

---

## 3. Key insights
### 3.1 Differentiators to amplify
- Authentic Hebrew pronunciation and warmth (recorded by a child) can feel personal and memorable.
- Simplicity is a feature in kids products. Lean into it.

### 3.2 Gaps to close (highest ROI)
1) **Activation gap**: new users land on a page, tap a few times, then leave without a guided win.
2) **Progress gap**: no visible “I improved” signal for parents, so value is hard to judge.
3) **Return gap**: nothing pulls families back tomorrow.
4) **Content depth gap**: categories are broad but not deep. Kids learn through structured repetition and small steps.

---

## 4. Target audiences and positioning
### 4.1 Audience segments (high value)
1) **Parents of ages 2-7** (Israel + diaspora)
   - Needs: safe, simple, educational, quick sessions, no junk.
2) **Diaspora families** (heritage learners)
   - Needs: pronunciation confidence, family routines, bilingual support.
3) **Educators** (preschool, Hebrew school, afterschool)
   - Needs: classroom-friendly activities, printable packs, predictable flows.

### 4.2 Positioning (one-liner)
Lepdy is a child-safe Hebrew starter kit that turns short daily play into authentic pronunciation and early reading foundations.

### 4.3 Messaging by segment (examples)
- Parents: “5 minutes a day. Real Hebrew sounds. Calm and safe.”
- Diaspora: “Build heritage Hebrew at home with authentic pronunciation.”
- Educators: “Ready-made Hebrew practice: tracing, stories, and printable packs.”

---

## 5. Product principles (guardrails)
1) Child-safe by default (no dark patterns, no risky external links).
2) Minimize data collection; parent-only flows for any persistence.
3) Fast on mobile and tablets, including budget devices.
4) Short sessions (3-15 minutes) with clear ends and wins.
5) Rewards are gentle and non-transactional (no pressure, no competition).

---

## 6. The core loop and what to optimize
**Discover → Tap → Hear → Repeat → Win → Return**

Optimization goals:
- Reduce time-to-first-win.
- Increase meaningful repetition (practice design).
- Create calm reasons to return.
- Make progress visible without personal data.

---

## 7. UX: top improvements (ranked Impact / Effort)
Scale: Impact (1-5), Effort (1-5). Start with high impact, low effort.

1) **Start Here (60-second guided session)** (5/2)  
   - A single entry point that gives a fast win and suggests the next step.

   - Rotating micro plan: “5 letter taps”, “3 matches”, “2 words”.
3) **Local streak + gentle celebration** (4/2)  
   - Device-only streak with opt-out and reduced-motion support.
4) **Sticker book collection** (4/3)  
   - Earn by learning actions, not by randomness.
5) **Progress map** (4/3)  
   - “Letters seen, letters traced, words built, games completed”.
6) **Better navigation for kids** (4/2)  
   - Bigger tap targets, consistent back/home, clear section titles.
7) **Audio-first UX** (4/3)  
   - Preload next audio, quick replay button, consistent volume.
8) **Parent gate** (4/2)  
   - Parent-only access to settings, feedback, and progress.
9) **Reduced motion + calm mode** (3/2)  
   - Good for sensitive kids and accessibility.
10) **Session end screen** (3/2)  
   - “You did it” summary + suggested next activity + return trigger.

## 8. Content strategy: depth and progression
### 8.1 Letters progression (recommended ladder)
1) Recognition: tap and hear.
2) Sound matching: hear a sound, choose the letter.
3) Final forms: introduce ך ם ן ף ץ with simple games.
4) Tracing: guided strokes, snap-to-path tolerance.
5) Syllables: ב + ַ = “ba” style drills (start small).
6) Simple words: 2-3 letter words using already-known letters.

### 8.2 Vocabulary expansion (beyond categories)
Create themed sets that support routines and stories:
- Family and home (אמא, אבא, בית)
- School and kindergarten (גן, ספר, ילד)
- Verbs for action (רץ, אוכל, שותה)
- Emotions (שמח, עצוב)
- Holidays packs (optional, later)

### 8.3 Three signature experiences (choose 2-3)
1) **Letter Tracing + pronunciation reinforcement**
   - Guided and free draw modes
   - “Say it, trace it, see it”
2) **Read-along micro stories**
   - 6-10 screens, tap each word to hear it
   - Ends with a tiny quiz
3) **Song snippets and rhythm drills**
   - Short clips and repeat patterns for letters and colors
   - “Tap on beat” mini game

---

## 9. Growth plan (audience, SEO, partnerships)
### 9.1 SEO per page type
For every category page in each language:
- Unique title and meta description (not templated)
- Short human-written intro (100-200 words) explaining who it is for and how to use it
- Internal links: learn → category → games → mission
- Correct hreflang and canonical per /, /en, /ru
- Add structured data where sensible (FAQ on parent pages, breadcrumbs)

### 9.2 Distribution channels that fit kids products
- Diaspora communities (Facebook groups, WhatsApp groups, synagogues, community centers)
- Preschools and Hebrew schools (offer printable packs, classroom landing page)
- Parenting creators (short demos with real Hebrew audio angle)
- App directories and educator resource sites (later)

### 9.3 Referral loop (parent-only)
- Parent area: “Share Lepdy”
- Reward: printable pack, bonus missions, or story pack (non-monetary)

## 17. What “2.0” looks like
A child can open Lepdy and within 60 seconds:

A parent can quickly verify value:

That is the leap from “content pages” to “product”.
