# Lepdy Strategic Product Roadmap v3.0
## Business + Product + Design Unified Strategy

**Document Version:** 3.0 | **Last Updated:** January 2026 | **Scope:** 24-Month Execution Plan
**Focus:** Integrated business scaling, product innovation, and UX excellence for young Hebrew learners

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Lepdy stands at an inflection point. V2.0 provided a world-class business strategy (monetization, international expansion, compliance). V3.0 adds the missing dimension: **product innovation and design strategy** that directly drives the engagement metrics V2.0 targets.

**The V3.0 Thesis:**
Children won't return because of smart monetization or international reach. They return because:
1. **Content grows with them** (alphabet → phonics → words → reading → comprehension)
2. **Every game mechanic teaches** (not just entertains)
3. **UI gets out of their way** (intuitive, age-appropriate, joyful)
4. **Progress feels visible** (streaks, badges, stories unlocked)
5. **Authentic voice + beautiful design** remain differentiated

**V3.0 Approach:** Execute business roadmap (Phases 1-4 from V2.0) while simultaneously building product depth and design excellence that makes Lepdy the retention leader in Hebrew kids' education.

## SECTION 1: STRATEGIC CONTEXT & POSITIONING

### Current State Analysis (Updated)

**What Lepdy Has:**
- 107+ content items (letters, numbers, colors, shapes, animals, food, words)
- 6 games (Simon, Letter Rain, Memory Match, Speed Challenge, Word Builder, Guess)
- Authentic Hebrew voice (Noa), watercolor design, Russian language support
- Next.js tech stack, Vercel hosting, Firebase backend

**Critical Gap (Product-Level):**
Lepdy is a **content library with mini-games**, not a **learning platform with engagement loops**. This is the core retention problem—not a UI issue.

**Comparison Matrix: Lepdy vs. Competitors**

| Dimension | Lepdy | Khan Academy Kids | ABCmouse | Lingokids |
|-----------|-------|---|---|---|
| **Content Breadth** | 107 items | 500+ activities | 10,000+ activities | 1,000+ activities |
| **Content Depth** | Alphabet → Numbers | Alphabet → Math → Science | Alphabet → Reading → Math | Alphabet → Multiple languages |
| **Engagement Loops** | ❌ None | ✅ Progression + Streaks | ✅ Learning Path + Rewards | ✅ Playlearning + Streaks |
| **Game Design Strategy** | ❌ Varied, not integrated | ✅ Each teaches specific skills | ✅ Mastery-based progression | ✅ Story-driven learning |
| **Difficulty Scaling** | ❌ Static | ✅ Adaptive | ✅ Adaptive | ✅ Adaptive |
| **Visual Design** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (watercolor, authentic) | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Parent Engagement** | ❌ None | ✅ Dashboard | ✅ Dashboard | ✅ Dashboard |
| **Unique Strength** | Authentic Israeli voice | Free, Stanford-backed | Comprehensive curriculum | Bilingual focus |

**Key Insight:** Lepdy's design is more beautiful than competitors. But **beautiful doesn't retain**—engaging content + clear progression + rewarding gameplay do.

### Strategic Vision (3D Framework)

**Pillar 1: Business Excellence** *(V2.0 foundation)*
- Scale from 5K → 100K MAU across 24 months
- Achieve $15,500 MRR by Month 24
- Expand to diaspora markets (US, Europe, South America)
- Build sustainable, profitable business

**Pillar 2: Product Innovation** *(NEW - V3.0)*
- Create structured content progression (alphabet → literacy)
- Design games around learning mechanics (not just fun)
- Implement adaptive difficulty & personalization
- Build engagement loops that create daily habits

**Pillar 3: Design Excellence** *(NEW - V3.0)*
- Maintain watercolor aesthetic while improving usability
- Optimize UX for different age groups (different needs)
- Ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) expands reach
- Create intuitive navigation that feels like play

**The Integrated Approach:**
These pillars must advance together. Phase 1 activates all three simultaneously—not sequentially.

## SECTION 2: PRODUCT STRATEGY & CONTENT ROADMAP

### Content Progression Framework

**Problem:** Current Lepdy has no learning progression. Child completes alphabet, then what? Dead end.

**Solution:** Structured content progression that mirrors how children learn to read.

#### Level 1: Letter Mastery (Phase 1-2)
**Goal:** Child recognizes & sounds out all 22 Hebrew letters

**Content:**
- All 22 letters with Noa's authentic pronunciation
- Letter formation (uppercase + lowercase)
- Visual letter associations (aleph = apple/adom/etz)
- Sound isolation exercises (focus on sound, not letter name)

**Games:**
- Letter Tracing (Canvas-based stroke guidance)
- Sound Matching (hear sound, select letter)
- Letter Rain (letters fall, tap to hear sound)

**Success Criteria:**
- Child can identify 15/22 letters visually
- Child can produce sounds for 10/22 letters
- Completion time: 3-4 weeks of daily engagement

---

#### Level 2: Phonics & Word Building (Phase 2-3)
**Goal:** Child combines letters into simple words

**Content:**
- 138 Hebrew words organized by phonetic patterns
- CVC words first (Consonant-Vowel-Consonant: קַט = small)
- Two-syllable words (יִשׁ = cat family)
- Common sight words (אֲנִי = I, אַתָּה = you)
- Vocabulary by theme: animals, food, family, colors

**Games:**
- Word Builder (drag letters to form words, hear pronunciation)

- Word Hunter (find words in a scene)
- Fill-in-the-Word (missing letter puzzle)

**Success Criteria:**
- Child recognizes 30+ written words
- Child can sound out 10+ unfamiliar words independently
- Completion time: 4-6 weeks

---

**Content:**
- 10 illustrated stories (15-30 seconds each) with audio & text
- Story themes: family, animals, daily routines, Hebrew traditions
- Interactive reading: tap words to hear pronunciation
- Comprehension questions (simple yes/no, multiple choice)
- Sight word introduction (high-frequency Hebrew words)

**Games:**
- Story Builder (arrange words into sentence)
- Comprehension Quiz (answer story questions)
- Word Detective (find specific words in text)
- Read-Along (child reads part, app reads part)

**Success Criteria:**
- Child reads simple 3-4 word sentences independently
- Child answers 70%+ comprehension questions correctly
- Child completes 5+ stories

---

#### Level 4: Advanced Literacy & Grammar (Phase 4+)
**Goal:** Child begins Hebrew reading comprehension & basic grammar

**Content:**
- 50 intermediate stories (with Hebrew cultural context)
- Grammar introduction: verb tenses, plurals, gender

- Translation Pairs (Hebrew ↔ English simple phrases)

**Success Criteria:**
- Child reads 150+ word stories
- Child demonstrates basic grammar understanding
- Child attempts creative writing

---

### Game Design Mechanics & Engagement

**Core Principle:** Every game must teach a specific skill; entertainment is the delivery mechanism, not the goal.

#### Game 1: Letter Tracing (Phase 1 Priority)
**Learning Objective:** Letter formation, fine motor skills, letter recognition

**Mechanics:**
- Child traces letter on canvas with stroke guidance (ghost letter)
- Incorrect stroke is gently corrected (visual feedback, no penalty)
- On completion: animated letter celebrates, sound plays, character reacts
- Difficulty progression: Start with thick strokes → gradually thinner

**Engagement Loop:**
1. **Motivation:** "Can you draw the letter that sounds like /alef/?"
2. **Action:** Child traces letter
3. **Feedback:** Visual (highlighted correct path), Audio (letter sound), Emotional (character celebration)
4. **Reward:** Letter added to collection, badge progress incremented

**Retention Impact:** High (teaches most-requested feature)

---

#### Game 2: Word Builder (Phase 2 Priority)
**Learning Objective:** Phonics, letter-sound association, word recognition

**Mechanics:**
- 3-5 letter "building blocks" appear on screen
- Child drags letters to spell word (visual slot guidance)
- Each letter placement = sound plays (reinforces phonics)
- Correct spelling = animation + celebration
- Incorrect = gentle hint (highlight next correct letter)

**Engagement Loop:**
1. **Motivation:** "Build the word: קַט (small cat)"
2. **Action:** Child drag-drops letters
3. **Feedback:** Audio (each letter sound), Visual (letter highlight), Real-time progress
4. **Reward:** Word added to vocabulary, points earned, streak maintained

**Difficulty Progression:**
- Level 1: 3-letter words, letters pre-positioned
- Level 2: 4-letter words, letters scrambled
- Level 3: 5-letter words, no hints
- Level 4: Spell word from sound (no visual reference)

**Retention Impact:** Very High (core engagement loop)

---

#### Game 3: Story Matching / Reading (Phase 3 Priority)
**Learning Objective:** Reading comprehension, sight words, story engagement

**Mechanics:**
- Story appears with text + audio
- Child taps words to hear pronunciation (reduces intimidation)
- After story: 3-5 comprehension questions
- Correct answers unlock story illustrations or achievements
- Child's reading progress tracked visually

**Engagement Loop:**
1. **Motivation:** "Read the story about [character]"
2. **Action:** Child reads (self-paced, tappable words)
3. **Feedback:** Audio support, visual celebration of milestones
4. **Reward:** Story badge, character progression, new stories unlocked

**Difficulty Progression:**
- Stories progress from 20 words → 100+ words
- Comprehension questions increase in complexity

**Retention Impact:** High (creates "aha moment" when child reads full sentence)

---

#### Existing Games (Repurposed for Learning)

**Simon Game** → Reframe as "Sound Memory" (auditory learning)
- Each note = Hebrew letter sound
- Pattern length increases with mastery
- Leaderboard shows peer comparison (motivational)

**Memory Match** → Reframe as "Letter/Word Matching"
- Pairs: Letter sound + picture (aleph = apple 🍎)
- Pairs: Word + illustration (קַט = cat image)
- Difficulty: 4 pairs (easy) → 16 pairs (hard)

**Speed Challenge** → Reframe as "Sound Sprint"
- Hear sound, select correct letter (under time pressure)
- Adaptive difficulty: easy if < 50% correct, hard if > 80%
- Builds automaticity (trained response to sound)

## CONCLUSION: V3.0 Vision

V2.0 asked: **"How do we build a sustainable business?"** and answered brilliantly.

V3.0 asks: **"How do we build a product so engaging that business becomes inevitable?"**

**The V3.0 Thesis:**
- **Beautiful design alone doesn't retain** (Lepdy has this; retention still low)
- **Engagement loops do** (streaks, badges, visible progress, mastery)
- **Content progression does** (alphabet → reading, not dead ends)
- **Game mechanics that teach do** (not just entertain)
- **Parent trust does** (dashboards, transparency, results)

V3.0 executes all five simultaneously across 24 months.

**By Month 24, Lepdy will be:**
- ✅ **Most engaging Hebrew learning app** (retention leader)
- ✅ **Most beautiful & authentic** (design + voice differentiation)
- ✅ **Most accessible** (WCAG 2.1 AA + age variants)
- ✅ **Most trusted by parents** (transparent, results-focused)
- ✅ **Most profitable** (sustainable at $15,500 MRR)

**Ready for execution.**
